# DIO's repository creation challenge
This repository was created with the intention of practicing and improve my abilities in Git/GitHub, and also to be part of the DIO community.

The README.md file contains the project presentation message, and within the only branch (_main_) available, there are two folders: one containing notes made to the current moment of the course, and the latter containing useful links of which helped me conclude this small project.

Thank you!
